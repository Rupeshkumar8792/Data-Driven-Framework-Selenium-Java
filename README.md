# Data-Driven-Framework-Selenium-Java

Developing a data-driven framework using Selenium with Java, TestNG, and Maven involves integrating these technologies to efficiently handle test data, execute tests, and manage dependencies. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create such a framework:

Step 1: Set Up Maven Project
Create a new Maven project in your IDE or using the command line.
Add dependencies for Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and any other libraries you may need in the pom.xml file.
Step 2: Create TestNG Test Classes
Write your test classes using TestNG annotations (@Test, @DataProvider, etc.).
Define test methods that will interact with web elements using Selenium WebDriver.
Implement data-driven testing by using TestNG's @DataProvider annotation to supply test data to test methods.
Step 3: Implement Data Providers
Create data provider methods in your test classes to supply test data to test methods.
Data can be provided from various sources like arrays, CSV files, Excel sheets, databases, etc.
Use libraries like Apache POI or OpenCSV to read data from Excel or CSV files.
Step 4: Set Up WebDriver Initialization and Tear Down
Implement methods for WebDriver initialization and teardown (@BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod annotations).
Initialize the WebDriver instance in the setup method and quit it in the teardown method.
Step 5: Run Tests Using TestNG
Run your tests using TestNG either from your IDE or using Maven commands (mvn test).
TestNG will execute the test methods and generate test reports.
Step 6: Analyze Test Results
TestNG generates detailed HTML reports after test execution.
Analyze the test reports to identify passed, failed, or skipped tests.
